Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced
mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the
summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and
the other from the north in Tibet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet>.
While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the
standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness>, weather, and wind, as
well as hazards from avalanches <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Avalanche> and the Khumbu Icefall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Khumbu_Icefall>. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest>. Over 200 bodies remain
on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous
conditions.^[6] <#cite_note-Climber_News-9> ^[7] <#cite_note-Nuwer-10>

The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by
British mountaineers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering>. As
Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the
British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan
side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1921_British_Mount_Everest_reconnaissance_expedition> reached 7,000 m
(22,970 ft) on the North Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Col>,
the 1922 expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1922_British_Mount_Everest_expedition> pushed the north ridge route up
to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above
8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1924_British_Mount_Everest_expedition> resulted in one of the greatest
mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory> and Andrew Irvine <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Irvine_(mountaineer)> made a final summit
attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they
were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay> and Edmund Hillary <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary> made the first documented ascent
of Everest in 1953 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1953_British_Mount_Everest_expedition>, using the southeast ridge route.
Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of
the 1952 Swiss expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1952_Swiss_Mount_Everest_expedition>. The Chinese mountaineering team of
Wang Fuzhou <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Fuzhou>, Gonpo <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongbu_(mountaineer)>, and Qu Yinhua made the
first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge <https://

%22Papers_relating_to_the_Himalaya_and_Mount_Everest%22_in_Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Geographical_Society_of_London,_Vol._I_(1857),_p._346.jpg>The name "Mount Everest" was first proposed in this 1856 speech, later published in 1857, in which the mountain was first confirmed as the world's highest.

The Tibetan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Tibetan> name for
Everest is /Qomolangma/ (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
%E0%BD%87%E0%BD%BC%E0%BC%8B%E0%BD%98%E0%BD%BC%E0%BC%8B%E0%BD%82%E0%BE%B3%E0%BD%84%E0%BC%8B%E0%BD%98>, lit. "holy mother"). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Kangxi> of Qing China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_China>, and then appeared as /Tchoumour Lancma/ on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Bourguignon_d%27Anville> based on the former map.^[9] <#cite_note-12> The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as /Chomolungma/ and (in Wylie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration>) as /Jo-mo-glang-ma/.^[14] <#cite_note-17>

The official Chinese transcription <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Transcription_into_Chinese_characters> is 珠穆朗玛峰 <https://
en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%8F%A0%E7%A9%86%E6%9C%97%E7%8E%9B%E5%B3%B0> (t

<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin> form is /Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng/. While other
Chinese names were used, including /Shèngmǔ Fēng/ (t <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_characters> 聖母峰 <https://
en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%81%96%E6%AF%8D%E5%B3%B0>, s <https://

en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9C%A3%E6%AF%8D%E5%B3%B0>, lit. "holy mother
peak"), these names were largely phased out when the Ministry of
Internal Affairs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ministry_of_Civil_Affairs> of China issued a decree to adopt a sole name
in May 1952.^[15] <#cite_note-18>

Other documented local names include "Deodungha" ("holy mountain"), but
it is unclear whether it is commonly used.^[16] <#cite_note-19>

In 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible
(e.g., Kangchenjunga <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangchenjunga> and
Dhaulagiri <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaulagiri>), and Andrew Waugh
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Scott_Waugh>, the British Surveyor
General of India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Surveyor_General_of_India>, argued that he could not find any commonly
used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal's
and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there
were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all
others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor
Sir George Everest <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Everest>, his
predecessor as Surveyor General of India.^[17] <#cite_note-
everest_bwp70-20> ^[18] <#cite_note-ReferenceA-21> ^[19] <#cite_note-
rgs1857-22> Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told
the Royal Geographical Society <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Royal_Geographical_Society> in 1857 that "Everest" could not be written
in Hindi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi> nor pronounced by "the
native of India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people>". Waugh's
proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal
Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name.^[17]
<#cite_note-everest_bwp70-20> ^[20] <#cite_note-23> The modern
pronunciation of Everest (/ˈɛvərɪst/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Help:IPA/English>)^[21] <#cite_note-24> is different from Sir George's
pronunciation of his surname (/ˈiːvrɪst/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Help:IPA/English> /EEV-rist/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key>).^[22] <#cite_note-25> In the late
19th century, many European cartographers <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cartography> incorrectly believed that a native name for the
mountain was Gaurishankar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaurishankar>,
a mountain between Kathmandu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu>
and Everest.^[23] <#cite_note-Waddell-26>

In Nepali <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language>, the peak is
called /Sagarmāthā/ (IAST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration> transcription) or /
Sagar-Matha/^[24] <#cite_note-Sagar-Matha:_Nepal-27> (सगर-माथा,

"goddess of the sky"^[25] <#cite_note-Krakauer-1997-28> ),^[26]
<#cite_note-Unsworth584-29> which means "the head in the great blue
sky", being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning "sky", and माथा (māthā),
meaning "head".

      19th century

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MountEverestRelief.png>Mount Everest
relief map <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_relief_depiction>

In 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Trigonometrical_Survey> of India to fix the
locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting
in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant
theodolites <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite>, each weighing
500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as
accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the
1830s, but Nepal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal> was
unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of
their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were
denied.^[17] <#cite_note-everest_bwp70-20>

The British were forced to continue their observations from Terai
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terai>, a region south of Nepal which is
parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of
torrential rains and malaria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria>.
Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire
because of failing health.^[17] <#cite_note-everest_bwp70-20>

Nonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began
detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations
up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three
months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Scott Waugh <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Scott_Waugh>, the British Surveyor General
of India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveyor_General_of_India>, made
several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the
Himalayas. Kangchenjunga <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangchenjunga>
was then considered the highest peak in the world <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_past_presumed_highest_mountains>, and with
interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John
Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site
farther west and called it peak "b". Waugh would later write that the
observations indicated that peak "b" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but
closer observations were required for verification. The following year,
Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations
of peak "b", but clouds thwarted his attempts.^[17] <#cite_note-
everest_bwp70-20>

In 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two
observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the
largest theodolite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite> and headed
east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with
the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.^[17] <#cite_note-
everest_bwp70-20>

Nicolson retreated to Patna <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna> on the
Ganges <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges> to perform the necessary
calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average
height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak "b", but this did not consider
light refraction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_refraction>, which
distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak "b"
was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was
forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael
Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based
on Roman numerals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals>, with
Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak "b" now became known as Peak XV.^[17]
<#cite_note-everest_bwp70-20>

In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehradun>, Radhanath Sikdar <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhanath_Sikdar>, an Indian mathematician and
surveyor from Bengal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal> was the
first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using
trigonometric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry> calculations
based on Nicolson's measurements.^[29] <#cite_note-BBC_mwde-32> An
official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for
several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began
work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost
two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of
light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast
distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his
findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata>. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m
(28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft).
Waugh concluded that Peak XV was "most probably the highest in the
world".^[17] <#cite_note-everest_bwp70-20> Peak XV (measured in feet)
was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was
publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the
impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing
more than a rounded estimate.^[30] <#cite_note-tas1982-33> Waugh is
sometimes playfully credited with being "the first person to put two
feet on top of Mount Everest".^[31] <#cite_note-34>

In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as
8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on
observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Trigonometrical_Survey>.^[32]
<#cite_note-35> From 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_of_India>, using triangulation <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation> methods, determined that the height
of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft).^[33] <#cite_note-everest-
height-1952-1954-36> In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese
measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).^[34] <#cite_note-ABC_au-37> In
both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured. The 8,848 m
(29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and
China.^[35] <#cite_note-38> Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to
determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake> affected the height of the
mountain.^[36] <#cite_note-39>

In May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford
Washburn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Washburn> anchored a
GPS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System> unit into
the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a
snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this
device.^[37] <#cite_note-alpres-40> Although as of 2001, it has not been
officially recognised by Nepal,^[38] <#cite_note-41> this figure is
widely quoted. Geoid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid> uncertainty
casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see §
21st-century surveys <#21st-century_surveys>) surveys.^[39] <#cite_note-42>

In 1955, a detailed photogrammetric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Photogrammetry> map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu> region, including the south side of Mount
Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
index.php?title=Erwin_Schneider&action=edit&redlink=1> as part of the
1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhotse>.

In the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography> map of the Everest area was made under
the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_photography>.^[40] <#cite_note-
washburn_map-43>


      21st century

On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences> and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping
announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with
accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and
precise measurement to date.^[41] <#cite_note-
Junyong_Yanping_Janli_Chunxi_2010_pp._122–131-44> This height is based
on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The
Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),^[34]
<#cite_note-ABC_au-37> which is in agreement with a net elevation of
8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to
whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China)
or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the
height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that
the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.^[42] <#cite_note-45> On 8
December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the
new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).^[43]
<#cite_note-46> ^[44] <#cite_note-dec_2020_height-47>

It is thought that the plate tectonics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Plate_tectonics> of the area are adding to the height and moving the
summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm
(0.16 in) per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year
horizontally,^[37] <#cite_note-alpres-40> ^[45] <#cite_note-48> but
another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),^[46]
<#cite_note-49> and even shrinkage has been suggested.^[47] <#cite_note-50>


      Comparisons

For a more comprehensive list, see List of highest mountains on Earth
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_mountains_on_Earth>.

The summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the
greatest distance above sea level <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Above_sea_level>. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be
the "tallest mountains on Earth". Mauna Kea <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Mauna_Kea> in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;^[note
4] <#cite_note-base-51> it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) from its
base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above
sea level.

By the same measure of base to summit, Denali <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Denali>, in Alaska <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska>, formerly
known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.^[note 4]
<#cite_note-base-51> Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m
(20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300
to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of
5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is
5,600 m (18,400 ft).^[48] <#cite_note-52> ^[49] <#cite_note-53> By
comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m
(13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan
Plateau <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau>, yielding a
height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to
15,260 ft).^[40] <#cite_note-washburn_map-43>

The summit of Chimborazo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo> in
Ecuador <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador> is 2,168 m (7,113 ft)
farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km, 3,967.1 mi) than that of
Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the
equator.^[50] <#cite_note-Robert_Krulwich-54> This is despite Chimborazo
having a peak of 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount
Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft).

    Geology

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EverestfromKalarPatarcrop.JPG>Mount
Everest with snow melted, showing upper geologic layers in bands

Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three
units called formations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Geologic_formation>.^[51] <#cite_note-Scientiav5-55> ^[52] <#cite_note-
IslandArcv14-56> Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle
faults <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)>, called
detachments <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_fault>, along
which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit
of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma
Formation, the North Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Col>
Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rongbuk_Glacier>.

The Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama
Formation,^[53] <#cite_note-Everest1953Geo-57> runs from the summit to
the top of the Yellow Band, about 8,600 m (28,200 ft) above sea level.
It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and
bedded, Ordovician <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician> limestone
interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite_(rock)> with argillaceous <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argillaceous_minerals> laminae <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment> and siltstone <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Siltstone>. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of
crinoids <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinoid> in this limestone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone>.^[54] <#cite_note-58> ^[55]
<#cite_note-59> Later petrographic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Petrograph> analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit
revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented
remains of trilobites <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite>,
crinoids, and ostracods <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracods>. Other
samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original
constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering
thrombolite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolite> bed that is 60 m
(200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the "Third Step <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Steps>", and base of the summit pyramid of
Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below
the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and
cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria>, in shallow marine waters.
The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that
terminate at the low angle normal fault <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Normal_fault>, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it
from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma
Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.^[51]
<#cite_note-Scientiav5-55> ^[52] <#cite_note-IslandArcv14-56> ^[56]
<#cite_note-MyrowOthers2009-60>

The bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and
28,200 ft), consists of the North Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
North_Col> Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part
between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft). The Yellow Band consists
of intercalated <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(geology)>
beds of Middle Cambrian diopside <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Diopside>-epidote <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidote>-bearing marble
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble>, which weathers a distinctive
yellowish brown, and muscovite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Muscovite>-biotite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotite> phyllite and
semischist <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schist>. Petrographic analysis
of marble collected from about 8,300 m (27,200 ft) found it to consist
as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid
ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the
Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) thick
fault breccia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breccia> separates it from
the overlying Qomolangma Formation.^[51] <#cite_note-Scientiav5-55>
^[52] <#cite_note-IslandArcv14-56> ^[56] <#cite_note-MyrowOthers2009-60>

The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to
8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered
and deformed schist, phyllite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllite>,
and minor marble. Between 7,600 and 8,200 m (24,900 and 26,900 ft), the
North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and
chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-
sericite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sericite>-quartz schist. Between
7,000 and 7,600 m (23,000 and 24,900 ft), the lower part of the North
Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with
epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of
quartzose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz> marble <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble>. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the
result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian> deep sea flysch <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flysch> composed of interbedded, mudstone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudstone>, shale <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale>, clayey sandstone <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone>, calcareous sandstone, graywacke
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graywacke>, and sandy limestone. The base
of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called
the "Lhotse detachment".^[51] <#cite_note-Scientiav5-55> ^[52]
<#cite_note-IslandArcv14-56> ^[56] <#cite_note-MyrowOthers2009-60>

Below 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col
Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of
sillimanite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sillimanite>-K-feldspar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-feldspar> grade schist and gneiss
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gneiss> intruded by numerous sills
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sill_(geology)> and dikes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)> of leucogranite <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite> ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m
(0.4 in to 4,900 ft).^[52] <#cite_note-IslandArcv14-56> ^[57]
<#cite_note-Searle1999a-61> These leucogranites are part of a belt of
Late Oligocene <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene>–Miocene
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene> intrusive rocks known as the
Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial
melting of Paleoproterozoic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Paleoproterozoic> to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the
Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the
subduction of the Indian Plate.^[58] <#cite_note-GuoOthers2012-62>

Mount Everest consists of sedimentary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sedimentary_rock> and metamorphic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Metamorphic_rock> rocks that have been faulted southward over
continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate
during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Himalaya>.^[59] <#cite_note-
pbs_nature-63> ^[60] <#cite_note-USGS-64> ^[61] <#cite_note-65> Current
interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations
consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental
shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it
collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia
subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them
southward and upward.^[62] <#cite_note-MyrowOthers2003a-66> ^[63]
<#cite_note-MyrowOthers2012a-67> The Rongbuk Formation consists of a
sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived
from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the
collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to
the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated,
metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20
kilometres (9.3 to 12.4 mi) below sea level; and then forced upward to
surface by thrusting towards the south between two major
detachments.^[64] <#cite_note-Searle2012a-68> The Himalayas are rising
by about 5 mm per year.


      IUGS geological heritage site

In respect of the recognition of the "highest rocks on the planet" as
fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest
were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences> (IUGS) in its assemblage of
100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in
October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site
as "a key place with geological elements and/or processes of
international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a
substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences
through history."^[65] <#cite_note-69>


    Flora and fauna

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yak_at_third_lake_in_Gokyo.jpg>A yak
at around 4,790 m (15,720 ft)

There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of moss
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss> grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft)
on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species.^[66]
<#cite_note-plants-70> An alpine cushion plant called /Arenaria
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arenaria_(plant)>/ is known to grow below
5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region.^[67] <#cite_note-autumn-71>
According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018,
vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found
plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.^[68] <#cite_note-72>

A minute black jumping spider <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jumping_spider> of the genus /Euophrys <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Euophrys>/ has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres
(22,000 ft),^[69] <#cite_note-wanless-73> possibly making it the highest
confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys
species, /E. everestensis <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=E._everestensis&action=edit&redlink=1>/, has been found at 5,030
metres (16,500 ft), and may feed on insects that have been blown there
by the wind.^[69] <#cite_note-wanless-73> There is a high likelihood of
microscopic life at even higher altitudes.

The bar-headed goose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-headed_goose>
migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher
altitudes of the mountain.^[70] <#cite_note-his7-74> In 1953, George
Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw
bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit.^[71] <#cite_note-75>
Another bird species, the chough <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chough>,
have been spotted as high as the South Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/South_Col> at 7,920 metres (25,980 ft)^[72] <#cite_note-jhunt-76>
and yellow-billed choughs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-
billed_chough> have been seen as high as 7,900 metres (26,000 ft).^[70]
<#cite_note-his7-74>

Yaks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak> are often used to haul gear for
Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100 kg (220 pounds), have
thick fur and large lungs.^[67] <#cite_note-autumn-71> Other animals in
the region include the Himalayan tahr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Himalayan_tahr>, which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_leopard>.^[73] <#cite_note-
thesis-77> The Himalayan black bear <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Himalayan_black_bear> can be found up to about 4,300 metres (14,000 ft)
and the red panda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda> is also
present in the region.^[74] <#cite_note-78> One expedition found a
surprising range of species in the region including a pika <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika> and ten new species of ants.^[75]

      Climate change

The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by
Khumbu Glacier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Glacier>, which is
rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change>, making it unsafe for climbers. As
recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate
and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the
director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to
move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer
distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. However, the
present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for
three to four years. The move may happen by 2024, per officials.^[77]

In 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation
went online.^[81] <#cite_note-uiaa-86> The project was orchestrated by
Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which
also placed the Mount Everest webcam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere> and penetrates the stratosphere
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere>.^[84] <#cite_note-dz-89>
The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is
at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and
freezing winds of the jet stream <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jet_stream>.^[85] <#cite_note-Peplow2004-90> Winds commonly attain
160 km/h (100 mph);^[86] <#cite_note-theweek-91> in February 2004, a
wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit.

These winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into
chasms^[86] <#cite_note-theweek-91> or (by Bernoulli's principle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle>) by lowering the
air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14
percent.^[85] <#cite_note-Peplow2004-90> ^[87] <#cite_note-92> To avoid
the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in
the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Monsoon> season is starting up or ending.

Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has
attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the
mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been
climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of
the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been
established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the
mountain.^[88] <#cite_note-93> ^[89] <#cite_note-94> ^[/
better source needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS>/]

Everest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953,
and interest from climbers increased thereafter.^[90] <#cite_note-la-95>
Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200
people had summited by 1987.^[90] <#cite_note-la-95> Everest remained a
difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional
climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the
commercial era began in the 1990s.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96> By
March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.^[92]
<#cite_note-97> By 2013, The Himalayan Database <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Himalayan_Database> recorded 6,871 summits by
4,042 different people.^[93] <#cite_note-alanarnette.com-98>

Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so
high the jet stream <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream> can hit
it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the
weather shifts.^[94] <#cite_note-99> At certain times of the year the
jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the
mountain.^[95] <#cite_note-wind-100> Other dangers include blizzards and
avalanches.^[95] <#cite_note-wind-100>


      Early attempts

In 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clinton_Thomas_Dent>, president of the Alpine Club <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Club_(UK)>, suggested that climbing Mount
Everest was possible in his book /Above the Snow Line/.^[96]
<#cite_note-101>

The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory> and Guy Bullock <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Bullock> on the initial 1921 British
Reconnaissance Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1921_British_Mount_Everest_reconnaissance_expedition>. It was an
exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the
mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to
set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude
of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the
top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.

The British returned for a 1922 expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/1922_British_Mount_Everest_Expedition>. George Finch <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Finch_(chemist)> climbed using oxygen for
the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—290 metres (951 ft)
per hour—and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time
a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix
Norton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Felix_Norton> made a second
unsuccessful attempt.

The next expedition was in 1924 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1924_British_Mount_Everest_Expedition>. The initial attempt by Mallory
and Geoffrey Bruce <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Geoffrey_Bruce_(mountaineer)> was aborted when weather conditions
prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of
Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather,
traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Couloir>. Norton managed to reach 8,550 m
(28,050 ft), though he ascended only 30 m (98 ft) or so in the last
hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He
chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.^[97] <#cite_note-102>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Condor_Films_1952.jpg>1952 documentary

On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Irvine_(mountaineer)> made an attempt on
the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from
which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine
Research Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mallory_and_Irvine_Research_Expedition> found Mallory's body on the
North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site
of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community
whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the
confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary> and Tenzing Norgay
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay> in 1953.

In 1933, Lady Houston <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Lucy,_Lady_Houston>, a British millionairess <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Millionaire>, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston%E2%80%93Mount_Everest_flight_expedition>,
which saw a formation of two aeroplanes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill
Tilman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Tilman> and a small party
which included Charles Houston <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Charles_Snead_Houston>, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an

The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1952_Swiss_Mount_Everest_Expedition>, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edouard_Wyss-Dunant>, was granted
permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through
the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of
7,986 m (26,201 ft). Raymond Lambert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Raymond_Lambert> and Sherpa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sherpa_people> Tenzing Norgay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tenzing_Norgay> were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m
(28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude
record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of
the British expedition in 1953.^[103] <#cite_note-108> The Swiss decided
to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the
South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.^[104]

In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunt,_Baron_Hunt>, returned to Nepal. Hunt
selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first
pair, Tom Bourdillon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bourdillon> and
Charles Evans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Charles_Evans_(mountaineer)>, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit
on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As
planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen
caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the
expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second
climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary> and Tenzing Norgay <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay>, a Nepali Sherpa <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people> climber. They reached the summit at
11:30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time,
both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but
Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the
summit first.^[106] <#cite_note-Ullman-111> They paused at the summit to
take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow
before descending.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

In 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The
centrepiece was a large "siege"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saburo_Matsukata>, working on finding a
new route up the southwest face.^[110] <#cite_note-
FOOTNOTEUnsworth2000594-115> Another element of the expedition was an
attempt to ski Mount Everest.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96> Despite a
staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the
expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned
routes.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96> However, Japanese expeditions did
enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuichiro_Miura> became the first man to ski down
Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres
(4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.
Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the
South Col route.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96> ^[111] <#cite_note-116>
^[112] <#cite_note-117> Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and
he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003
at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.^[113] <#cite_note-118>

In 1975, Junko Tabei <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junko_Tabei> became
the first woman to summit Mount Everest.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96>

The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition <https://

In 1978, Reinhold Messner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

oxygen.


      1979/1980: Winter Himalaism

File:Mount_Everest_winter_1980_cert.jpg>Confirmation of the summit
obtained by Nepal's Ministry of Tourism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nepal_Tourism_Board>

The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Andrzej_Zawada> headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the
first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish
climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Glacier> in early January 1980. On
15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea
level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The
weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszek_Cichy>, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Wielicki> set up camp IV on
South Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Col> (7906 m). Cichy and
Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February. At 2:40 pm
Andrzej Zawada <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Zawada> at base
camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – "We are on the summit!
The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold."^[114]

<#cite_note-121> ^[117] <#cite_note-122> The successful winter ascent of
Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a
Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on
8000 metre peaks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-thousander>, which
earned Polish climbers a reputation of "Ice Warriors".^[118]

      Lho La tragedy, 1989

In May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak
organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult
western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but
ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24
May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m,
overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an
avalanche from the side of Khumbutse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Khumbutse> near the Lho La <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lho_La> pass,
four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław
Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Zygmunt_Andrzej_Heinrich> and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to
his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was
saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Hajzer> and New Zealanders Gary Ball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Ball> and Rob Hall <https://

      1996 disaster

Main article: 1996 Mount Everest disaster <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster>

On 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided
expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a
summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while
climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a
single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths
in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2014_Mount_Everest_avalanche>. The guiding disaster gained wide
publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing
and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.

Journalist Jon Krakauer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer>, on
assignment from /Outside <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Outside_(magazine)>/ magazine, was in one of the affected guided
parties, and afterward published the bestseller /Into Thin Air <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_Thin_Air>/, which related his experience.
Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Boukreev> in his recollection of the
expedition.^[122] <#cite_note-Washington_Post-127> ^[123] <#cite_note-
Russia_Beyond-128> A year later, Boukreev co-authored /The Climb
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Climb_(book)>/, in part as a rebuttal
of Krakauer's portrayal.^[124] <#cite_note-
New_York_Times_Review_The_Climb-129> The dispute sparked a debate within
the climbing community. Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine
Club's David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the
expedition.^[123] <#cite_note-Russia_Beyond-128>

In May 2004, physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L. Semple, both
researchers from the University of Toronto <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/University_of_Toronto>, told /New Scientist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist>/ magazine that an analysis of
weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels
to plunge about 14 per cent.^[125] <#cite_note-NewScientist-130> ^[126]
<#cite_note-BioEd_Online-131>

One of the survivors was Beck Weathers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Beck_Weathers>, left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at
7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain,
Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and
vision impaired due to snow blindness.^[127] <#cite_note-
badassoftheweek.com-132> When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers
considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die
overnight.^[128] <#cite_note-DMag-133> Weathers was lowered to Camp 2
and eventually a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali
Army.^[127] <#cite_note-badassoftheweek.com-132> ^[128] <#cite_note-
DMag-133>

The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where
several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by
British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Matt_Dickinson> in his book /The Other Side of Everest/. Sixteen-
year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his
account, /Within Reach: My Everest Story/.

The 2015 feature film /Everest <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Everest_(2015_film)>/, directed by Baltasar Kormákur <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Korm%C3%A1kur>, is based on the events of
this guiding disaster.^[129] <#cite_note-Baltasar-134>

In 2006, 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered
an international debate and years of discussion about climbing
ethics.^[133] <#cite_note-138> The season was also remembered for the
rescue of Lincoln Hall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Lincoln_Hall_(climber)> who had been left by his climbing team and
declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped
off the mountain.


        David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006

There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British
climber David Sharp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
David_Sharp_(mountaineer)>, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006
but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering
community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations,
and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a
man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have
attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and
fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.^[134] <#cite_note-top-139>
He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support
up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a "loose group", offering a
high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said
Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have
a Sherpa guide.^[135] <#cite_note-washingtontimes.com-140> It is less
clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they
were qualified or capable of helping him.^[134] <#cite_note-top-139>

Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mark_Inglis> said in an interview that his climbing party, and many
others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang
450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a
rescue.^[136] <#cite_note-abcnews052006-141> Inglis said 40 people had
passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed
Sharp was the corpse nicknamed "Green Boots <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Green_Boots>",^[137] <#cite_note-Sharp-142> but Inglis was not
aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the
process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bur%C3%A7ak_%C3%96zo%C4%9Flu_Po%C3%A7an>). There has also been some
discussion about Himex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himex> in the
commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments,
he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while
he was "physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had
suffered severe frostbite – he later had five fingertips
amputated."^[138] <#cite_note-thefever-143> It was estimated on 14 May
that Sharp summited Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May
he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and
down.^[139] <#cite_note-change-144> On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was
suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m (1,000 ft) from the summit on
the North Side route.^[139] <#cite_note-change-144>

    Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him
    move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to
    stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, Dawa
    had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas, it was not going to be
    possible to get David down the tricky sections below.

    — Jamie McGuiness^[140] <#cite_note-jamie-145> 

/The Tribune/ of Chandigarh, India <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
The_Tribune_(Chandigarh)> quoted someone who described what happened to
Sharp as "the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering".^[141]
<#cite_note-146> In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other
climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for
various guiding companies.^[142] <#cite_note-147>

Much of this controversy was captured by the /Discovery Channel
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Channel>/ while filming the
television program /Everest: Beyond the Limit <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Everest:_Beyond_the_Limit>/. A crucial decision affecting the fate
of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber,
Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Maxim_Chaya>, is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp
manager (Russell Brice <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brice>)
that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress.
Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without
any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base
camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already
calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that
there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As
Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending
climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and
feet curl from frostbite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite>,
preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on
oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas
to return and rescue him.

David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side
next to "Green Boots"; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was
an ad hoc tomb for them.^[139] <#cite_note-change-144> Sharp's body was
removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,^[143] <#cite_note-
britb-148> and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably
removed or buried.^[7] <#cite_note-Nuwer-10>


        Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006

As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber
Lincoln Hall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Hall_(climber)> was
found alive after being left for dead the day before.^[144]
<#cite_note-:2-149> He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mazur>, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne
and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with
Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry
him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from
cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.^[144]
<#cite_note-:2-149> There were no rocks around to do this and he was
abandoned.^[145] <#cite_note-:3-150> The erroneous information of his
death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered alive
by another party.^[145] <#cite_note-:3-150>


      2007

On 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meagan_McGrath> initiated the successful high-
altitude rescue of Nepali <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal> Usha
Bista. Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund
Hillary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary> Foundation of
Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has
personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act
in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.^[146] <#cite_note-151>


      Ascent statistics up to 2010 season

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EverestAscents.svg>Ascents of Mount
Everest by year through 2010

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sunrise_over_Everest.jpg>The sun
rising on Everest in 2011

By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to
the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents
being accomplished since 2000.^[147] <#cite_note-8000ers-152> The summit
was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed
between 1975 and 2014.^[147] <#cite_note-8000ers-152> In 2007, the
record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253
sherpas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people>.^[147]
<#cite_note-8000ers-152>

An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by
the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest
disaster <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster>
shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large
number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this
was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May
2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more
summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first
successful summit in 1953 through 1983.^[147] <#cite_note-8000ers-152>

There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922
British Mount Everest Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1922_British_Mount_Everest_Expedition> through the end of 2010, a rate
of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and
includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back
before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died
while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5 per
cent) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their
descent.^[147] <#cite_note-8000ers-152> Though the rate of fatalities
has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits,
with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total
number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the
northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and
2 on the north face.^[147] <#cite_note-8000ers-152>

Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main
routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In
2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more
challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route
was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and
the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were

The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-
to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there
were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set
records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters,
around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the
peak,^[150] <#cite_note-:0x-155> and a subsequent record was set in 2019
with over 890 summiters.^[151] <#cite_note-time5604758-156>

      2014 avalanche and season

Main article: 2014 Mount Everest avalanche <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/2014_Mount_Everest_avalanche>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mt_Everest.jpg>Mount Everest, 2014

On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp
2.^[159] <#cite_note-BBC-164> Sixteen people were killed (all Nepali
guides) and nine more were injured.^[160] <#cite_note-NYr-165> In
response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the
job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa
people mourning the loss.^[161] <#cite_note-npr-166> ^[162]
<#cite_note-167>

During the season, 13-year-old Malavath Purna reached the summit,
becoming the youngest female climber to do so.^[163] <#cite_note-
Times_of_India-168> One team used a helicopter to fly from South base
camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest
summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had
denied them a permit to climb. A team member (Jing Wang <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jing_(mountaineer)>) donated US$30,000 to a
local hospital.^[164] <#cite_note-news.nationalgeographic.com-169> She
was named the Nepali "International Mountaineer of the Year".^[164]

Over 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from
Nepal in the 2014 season.^[165] <#cite_note-170> This included 72-year-
old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Kipa> Sherpa who summited with her
elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhakpa_Sherpa>
in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of

      2015 avalanche, earthquake, season

Main article: 2015 Mount Everest avalanches <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/2015_Mount_Everest_avalanches>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Everest_from_Kalatop_April_2015.jpg>Everest, April 2015

2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of
permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China).
However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake> M_w <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale> triggered an avalanche
that hit Everest Base Camp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Everest_Base_Camp>,^[168] <#cite_note-173> effectively shutting down the
Everest climbing season.^[169] <#cite_note-174> 18 bodies were recovered
from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.^[170]
<#cite_note-175> The avalanche began on Pumori <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumori>,^[171] <#cite_note-176> moved through the
Khumbu Icefall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Icefall> on the
southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Everest_Base_Camp#South_Base_Camp_in_Nepal>.^[172] <#cite_note-177> 2015
was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing
teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.^[173] <#cite_note-178>
^[174] <#cite_note-WillEverest-179> One of the reasons for this was the
high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the
United States Geological Survey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
United_States_Geological_Survey>).^[175] <#cite_note-180> Just weeks
after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude
quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_aftershocks_of_April_2015_Nepal_earthquake>.^[176] <#cite_note-181>

The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and
they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on
supplies.^[177] <#cite_note-supplies-182> The quake shifted the route
through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to
climbers.^[177] <#cite_note-supplies-182> Bad weather also made
helicopter evacuation difficult.^[177] <#cite_note-supplies-182> The
Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal, with
almost nine thousand dead^[178] <#cite_note-drrportal-183> ^[179]
<#cite_note-D2015-184> and about 22,000 injured.^[178] <#cite_note-
drrportal-183> In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were
injured.^[180] <#cite_note-185> By 29 April 2015, the Tibet
Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other
peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north
side of Everest.^[181] <#cite_note-186> On the south side, helicopters
evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.^[182] <#cite_note-187>

On 24 August 2015, Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain
climbers.^[183] <#cite_note-188> The only climber permit for the autumn
season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried
four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his
fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just 700 m (2,300 ft) from
the summit due to "strong winds and deep snow".^[184] <#cite_note-189>
^[185] <#cite_note-190>

Some sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were
damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to
handle trekkers.^[186] <#cite_note-191>


      2016 season

2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of
summiters and a handful of deaths.^[188] <#cite_note-193> On 27 May
2017, Kami Rita <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami_Rita> made his 21st
climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of
three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apa_Sherpa> and Phurba Tashi Sherpa <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phurba_Tashi> to make it to the summit of Mount
Everest 21 times.^[189] <#cite_note-194> ^[190] <#cite_note-195> The
season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueli_Steck> of Switzerland, who died from a fall
during a warm-up climb.^[191] <#cite_note-196> There was a continued
discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Step>.^[192] <#cite_note-197>
Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.^[157] <#cite_note-

807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018,^[194] <#cite_note-:4-199>
including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet
side.^[150] <#cite_note-:0x-155> This broke the previous record for
total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that
aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days
during the critical spring climbing season.^[150] <#cite_note-:0x-155>
^[195] <#cite_note-auto5-200> ^[158] <#cite_note-:0-163> Various records

were no major disasters, but seven climbers including sherpas as well as
international climbers, died in various situations.^[150] <#cite_note-:

/*Declared dead after missing/

The spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a
number of climbers. Worldwide publication of images of hundreds of
mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports
of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the
world.^[200] <#cite_note-205> ^[201] <#cite_note-206> ^[202]
<#cite_note-207>

There were reports of various winter expeditions in the Himalayas,
including K2, Nanga Parbat, and Meru with the buzz for the Everest 2019
beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window.^[203] <#cite_note-
auto6-208> Noted climber Cory Richards announced on Twitter that he was
hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019.^[203]
<#cite_note-auto6-208> Also announced was an expedition to re-measure
the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015
earthquakes.^[204] <#cite_note-209> ^[205] <#cite_note-210> China closed
the base-camp to those without climbing permits in February 2019 on the
northern side of Mount Everest.^[206] <#cite_note-211> By early April,
climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring
climbing season.^[158] <#cite_note-:0-163> Among the teams was a
scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things
like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in
the region.^[207] <#cite_note-212> In the 2019 spring mountaineering
season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several
hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side.^[208]
<#cite_note-nbcrita-213> ^[209] <#cite_note-cnnrita-214> ^[210]
<#cite_note-bbcrita-215> Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for
2019.^[194] <#cite_note-:4-199> For the northern routes in Chinese
Tibet, several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by
authorities there.^[211] <#cite_note-216>

In May 2019, Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited Mount
Everest twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents, making
international news headlines.^[212] <#cite_note-:1-217> ^[208]
<#cite_note-nbcrita-213> ^[209] <#cite_note-cnnrita-214> He first
summited Everest in 1994, and has summited several other extremely high
mountains, such as K2 and Lhotse.^[208] <#cite_note-nbcrita-213> ^[209]
<#cite_note-cnnrita-214> ^[210] <#cite_note-bbcrita-215> ^[212]
<#cite_note-:1-217>

By 23 May 2019, about seven people had died, possibly due to crowding
leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather
windows.^[194] <#cite_note-:4-199> One 19-year-old who summited
previously noted that when the weather window opens, long lines form as
everyone rushes to get the top and back down.^[213] <#cite_note-218> In
Chinese Tibet, one Austrian climber died from a fall,^[194]
<#cite_note-:4-199> and by 26 May 2019 the overall number of deaths for
the spring climbing season rose to 10.^[214] <#cite_note-219> ^[215]
<#cite_note-:5-220> ^[216] <#cite_note-221> By 28 May, the death toll
increased to 11 when a climber died at about 7,900 m (26,000 ft) during
the descent,^[198] <#cite_note-upi.com-203> and a 12th climber missing
and presumed dead.^[199] <#cite_note-Slater-204> Despite the number of
deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the
spring 2019 climbing season.^[217] <#cite_note-:6-222> ^[151]
<#cite_note-time5604758-156>

Although China has had various permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a
doctor to sign off on climbing permits,^[217] <#cite_note-:6-222> the
natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with
medical issues aggravated by Everest's extreme altitude led to 2019
being a year with a comparatively high death toll.^[217] <#cite_note-:
6-222>


      2020s

Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020
season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
COVID-19_pandemic>. 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014
and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side.^[218]
<#cite_note-223>

A team of Chinese surveyors climbed Mt. Everest from the North side
during April–May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world's
highest peak during the pandemic, at least through May. The team was
there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.^[219] <#cite_note-224>

On 12 May 2022, the first all-Black team summited Mt. Everest. Seven men
and two women climbers from the U.S. and Kenya, guided by eight sherpas,
comprised the expedition.^[220] <#cite_note-225>

      Permits

In 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until
2019 due to the closure.^[222] <#cite_note-ekantipur1-227> In 2015,
Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of
the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year
extension to 2017.^[223] <#cite_note-kathmandupost.ekantipur.com-228>
^[222] <#cite_note-ekantipur1-227> ^[/clarification needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify>/]

In 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit
was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall. He faced, among
other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In
the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in
Nepal for 10 years.^[224] <#cite_note-229>

The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting
Everest.^[228] <#cite_note-233> They did not issue permits in 2008, due
to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.

<#cite_note-236> In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an

According to Jon Krakauer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer>,
the era of commercialisation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Commercialization> of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was
reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Breashears> that included Richard Bass
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bass>, a wealthy 55-year-old
businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing
experience.^[235] <#cite_note-240> By the early-1990s, several companies
were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Hall>, one of the mountaineers who died in the
1996 disaster <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1996_Mount_Everest_disaster>, had successfully guided 39 clients to the
summit before that incident.^[25] <#cite_note-Krakauer-1997-28> ^: 24, 42 

By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and
US$200,000.^[236] <#cite_note-heraldsun.com.au-241> Going with a
"celebrity guide", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with
decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can
cost over £100,000 as of 2015.^[237] <#cite_note-242> However, the
services offered vary widely and it is "buyer beware" when doing deals
in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the
world.^[236] <#cite_note-heraldsun.com.au-241> ^[238] <#cite_note-243>
Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product> (GDP) in 2019^[239]
<#cite_note-244> in a country with high unemployment,^[240]
<#cite_note-245> but an Everest porter can make nearly double the
nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are
lacking.^[241] <#cite_note-246>

Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically
possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there
are "budget" travel agencies that offer logistical support for such
trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp
and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000
as of 2007.^[138] <#cite_note-thefever-143> However, this is considered
difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sharp_(mountaineer)>).

Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of
US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_oxygen_(climbing)>, which adds around
US$3,000.^[242] <#cite_note-ClimbingMagazineCost-247> The permit to
enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to
US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team.^[242]
<#cite_note-ClimbingMagazineCost-247> The ascent typically starts at one
of the two base camps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everest_base_camps>
near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres
(60 mi) from Kathmandu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu> and 300
kilometres (190 mi) from Lhasa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa>
(the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's
equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as
US$2,000.^[242] <#cite_note-ClimbingMagazineCost-247>

Many climbers hire "full service" guide companies, which provide a wide
spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits,
transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_ropes>,^[243] <#cite_note-248> medical
assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and
even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The
cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per
person.^[244] <#cite_note-249> Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people>, clients of full-service
guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms
(22 lb), or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast,
climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali>, are often expected to carry backpacks
over 30 kilograms (66 lb) and, occasionally, to tow a sled <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled> with 35 kilograms (77 lb) of gear and
food.^[245] <#cite_note-250>

The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject
of criticism.^[152] <#cite_note-NG-20130600-157> Jamling Tenzing Norgay
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamling_Tenzing_Norgay>, the son of
Tenzing Norgay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay>, said in a
2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover
that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely
reaching the summit, "You still have to climb this mountain yourself
with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is
lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on
crampons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crampons>. They are climbing
because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers
the lives of others."^[246] <#cite_note-251>

One example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Shriya_Shah-Klorfine>, who had to be taught how to put on crampons
during her summit attempt in 2012.^[247] <#cite_note-252> She paid at
least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she
ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours
straight.^[248] <#cite_note-253>

Reinhold Messner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Messner>
concurred in 2004:

    You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for
    yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid.
    By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were
    finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You
    can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have
    always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High
    altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial
    trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and
    organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The
    route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available
    in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and
    lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the
    risks.^[249] <#cite_note-254>

By 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some
experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase
revenue.^[250] <#cite_note-255> One barrier to this is that low-budget
firms make money /not/ taking inexperienced climbers to the
summit.^[236] <#cite_note-heraldsun.com.au-241> Those turned away by
Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a
price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part
way up the mountain.^[236] <#cite_note-heraldsun.com.au-241>

However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers
have been strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary> stated in 2003 that while "Having
people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of
experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all",^[251]
<#cite_note-256> he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area
by Westerners:

    I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to
    improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in
    there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical
    facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we
    have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built
    bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines
    so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit
    them.^[252] <#cite_note-257>

One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Summits> fame) stated in 2003 that
"Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the
really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a
20,000-foot [6,100 m] mountain and 29,000-foot [8,800 m]. It's not just
arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the
altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—
an exponential curve. People climb Denali [6,190 m or 20,320 ft] or
Aconcagua [6,960 m or 22,834 ft] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here,
I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that."^[253] <#cite_note-
bass-258>


      Routes

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS058-101-12_2.JPG>Overview South
Col route and North Col/Ridge route

Mount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from
Nepal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal> and the north ridge from
Tibet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet>, as well as many other less
frequently climbed routes.^[254] <#cite_note-evhist-259> Of the two main
routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently
used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Edmund_Hillary> and Tenzing Norgay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tenzing_Norgay> in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top
by 1996.^[254] <#cite_note-evhist-259> This was, however, a route
decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border
was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's
Republic of China invaded Tibet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Invasion_of_Tibet_(1950)>.^[255] <#cite_note-ngetl-260>

Most attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon> season. As the monsoon season approaches,
the jet stream <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream> shifts
northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the
mountain.^[256] <#cite_note-nytimes-261> ^[257] <#cite_note-te03-262>
While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the
monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the
additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather
patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.


        Southeast ridge

The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everest_Base_Camp> at 5,380 m (17,700 ft)
on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into
Lukla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukla> (2,860 m) from Kathmandu
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu> and pass through Namche Bazaar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namche_Bazaar>. Climbers then hike to
Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper
altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness>.^[258] <#cite_note-
Acclimatization-263> Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak>, dzopkyos <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Dzo> (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_(carrier)> to Base Camp on the Khumbu
Glacier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Glacier>. When Hillary and
Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part
of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point)
started from the Kathmandu Valley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kathmandu_Valley>, as there were no roads further east at that time.

Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the
altitude. During that time, Sherpas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sherpa_(people)> and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders
in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Khumbu_Icefall>.

Seracs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serac>, crevasses <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crevasse>, and shifting blocks of ice make the
icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers
and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard,
climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing
temperatures glue ice blocks in place.

Above the icefall is Camp I at 6,065 metres (19,900 ft).

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inside_Khumbu-Icefall.jpg>Climber
traversing Khumbu Icefall

From Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Cwm> to the base of the Lhotse <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhotse> face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp
(ABC) is established at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). The Western Cwm is a flat,
gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the
centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm.
Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuptse>, to a small passageway known as
the "Nuptse corner". The Western Cwm is also called the "Valley of
Silence" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the
climbing route. The high altitude <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
High_altitude> and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm
unbearably hot for climbers.^[259] <#cite_note-nova-climb-264>

From Camp II, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_rope>, up to Camp III, located on a small
ledge at 7,470 m (24,500 ft). From there, it is another 500 metres to
Camp IV on the South Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Col> at
7,920 m (26,000 ft).

From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional
challenges: the Geneva Spur <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Spur>
and the Yellow Band <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Band>. The
Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss
expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1952_Swiss_Mount_Everest_Expedition>. Fixed ropes assist climbers in
scrambling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling> over this snow-
covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble>, phyllite <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllite>, and semischist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schist>, which also requires about 100 metres of
rope for traversing it.^[259] <#cite_note-nova-climb-264>

On the South Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Col>, climbers
enter the death zone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone>.
Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or
three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds
during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all
the way back down to Base Camp.

From Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with
hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within
10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach "The Balcony" at 8,400 m
(27,600 ft), a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to
the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge,
climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which
usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious
avalanche <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche> hazard. At 8,750 m
(28,700 ft), a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South
Summit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Summit_(Everest)>.^[259]
<#cite_note-nova-climb-264>

From the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge
along what is known as the "Cornice traverse", where snow clings to
intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a
misstep to the left would send one 2,400 m (7,900 ft) down the southwest
face, while to the immediate right is the 3,050 m (10,010 ft) Kangshung
Face <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangshung_Face>. At the end of this
traverse is an imposing 12 m (39 ft) rock wall, the Hillary Step
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Step>, at 8,790 m
(28,840 ft).^[260] <#cite_note-265>

Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and
they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays,
climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by
Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the
top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(heights)> on the ridge is extreme,
especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing
numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent^[/when? <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/
Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items>/] years, the Step has frequently
become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of
time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting
climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.^[/citation needed
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

After the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky
section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be
troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an
hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness
sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because
supplemental oxygen tanks run out.


        North ridge route

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mount_Everest_North_Face.jpg>Mount
Everest north face from Rongbuk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rongbuk_Monastery> in Tibet

The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet>. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk
Glacier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongbuk_Glacier>, setting up base
camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To
reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk
Glacier up to the base of Changtse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Changtse>, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft). Camp III (ABC – Advanced Base
Camp) is situated below the North Col <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
North_Col> at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). To reach Camp IV on the North Col,
climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are
used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft). From the North Col,
climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m
(25,500 ft). The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the
base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m
(27,000 ft). From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.

Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step:
ascending from 8,501 to 8,534 m (27,890 to 28,000 ft), to the crux of
the climb, the Second Step, ascending from 8,577 to 8,626 m (28,140 to
28,300 ft). (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the "Chinese
ladder", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of
Chinese climbers.^[261] <#cite_note-266> It has been almost continuously
in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on
the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is
clambered over, ascending from 8,690 to 8,800 m (28,510 to 28,870 ft).
Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of
50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is
reached.^[262] <#cite_note-NOVA_wtsn-267>


      Summit

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Amanecer_desde_la_cima_del_Everest_por_Carlos_Pauner.JPG>A view
from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013

The summit of Everest has been described as "the size of a dining room
table".^[263] <#cite_note-268> The summit is capped with snow over ice
over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.^[264]
<#cite_note-sci-269> The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone> and is a low-grade metamorphic
rock.^[265] <#cite_note-270> (See the Surveys <#Surveys> section for
more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.)

Below the summit, there is an area known as "rainbow valley", filled
with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to
about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the "death zone",
due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.^[84]
<#cite_note-dz-89>

Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides,
or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/North_Face_(Everest)>, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung
Face <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangshung_Face>.^[266] <#cite_note-

      Death zone

wiki/Effects_of_high_altitude_on_humans>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Everest_Peace_Project_-
_Everest_summit.jpg>The summit of Mount Everest from the North side

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Everest-fromKalarPatar.jpg>From Kala
Patthar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_Patthar>, Nepal

At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit
typically spend substantial time within the death zone <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone> (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres
(26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures
can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite> of any body part exposed to the air.
Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and
death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these
altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.

Another significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Breathing#Effects_of_ambient_air_pressure>. The atmospheric pressure at
the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333
standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only
about a third as much oxygen to breathe.^[267] <#cite_note-272>

Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most
climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres
(1.07 mi) from South Col to the summit.^[268] <#cite_note-273> Achieving
even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude
acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-
level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude
above 8,500 m (27,900 ft) without acclimatisation would likely lose
consciousness within two to three minutes.^[269] <#cite_note-274>

In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of
oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers
climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed
to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the
way to the summit.^[270] <#cite_note-275> Even at base camp, the low
partial pressure <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure> of
oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea
level, blood oxygen saturation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Oxygen_saturation_(medicine)#Definition> is generally 98 to 99 per cent.
At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood
samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the
blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased
breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more
typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to
breathe.^[271] <#cite_note-276>

Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all
contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in
serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and
carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die
during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies
remain on the mountain.^[7] <#cite_note-Nuwer-10>

    Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema
    commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest.
    Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early
    features associated with subsequent death.

    — Mortality on Mount Everest, 1921–2006: descriptive study^[272]
    <#cite_note-277> 

A 2008 study noted that the "death zone" is indeed where most Everest
deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from
the summit.^[273] <#cite_note-278> A 2014 article in /The Atlantic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic>/ about deaths on Everest
noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone
presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at
lower altitudes.^[274] <#cite_note-atlan-279>

Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by
some measurements, but it depends on the period.^[275] <#cite_note-
safer-280> Some examples are Kangchenjunga <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Kangchenjunga>, K2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2>, Annapurna
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Massif>, Nanga Parbat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanga_Parbat>, and the Eiger <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger> (especially the /nordwand/).^[275]
<#cite_note-safer-280> Some factors that affect total mountain lethality
include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those
climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.^[276] <#cite_note-
killermountains-281>

Another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Retinal_haemorrhage>, which can damage eyesight and cause
blindness.^[277] <#cite_note-eyes-282> Up to a quarter of Everest
climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually
heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber
went blind and died in the death zone.^[277] <#cite_note-eyes-282>

    At one o'clock in the afternoon, the British climber Peter Kinloch
    was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs
    of the Himalayas below, "elated, cheery and bubbly". But Mount
    Everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly
    went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.

    — A. McSmith^[277] <#cite_note-eyes-282> 

The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down
the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him
through the difficult sections.^[278] <#cite_note-theweek1-283> Even for
the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It
is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be
beyond the ability of rescuers to save /anyone/ in such a difficult
spot.^[278] <#cite_note-theweek1-283> One way around this situation was
pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off
the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their
plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and
supplies.^[279] <#cite_note-abcnews1-284> They successfully launched off
the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namche_Bazaar> in just 42 minutes, without having
to climb down the mountain.^[279] <#cite_note-abcnews1-284>

oxygen at Everest

Most expeditions use oxygen masks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Oxygen_mask> and tanks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_oxygen>
above 8,000 m (26,000 ft).^[280] <#cite_note-285> Everest can be climbed
without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished
mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans' ability to think clearly is
hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low
temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions.
While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled
oxygen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_oxygen> in order to reach
the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without
supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to
reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.^[281] <#cite_note-286>
Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in cerebral
hypoxia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hypoxia>.^[282]
<#cite_note-thom-287> One study found that Mount Everest may be the
highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may
suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower
altitudes.^[282] <#cite_note-thom-287>

The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been
controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest
Expedition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1922_British_Mount_Everest_Expedition> by George Finch <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Finch_(chemist)> and Geoffrey Bruce
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Bruce_(mountaineer)> who climbed
up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres
(1,000 ft) per hour. Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death
by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next
day they climbed to 8,100 m (26,600 ft) at 270 m/h (900 ft/h) – nearly
three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was
considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world
recognised this high ascent rate.^[/citation needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

George Mallory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory> described
the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that
it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently
used it on his final attempt in 1924.^[283] <#cite_note-288> When
Tenzing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay> and Hillary made
the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled
oxygen sets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_oxygen_(climbing)>,
with the expedition's physiologist Griffith Pugh <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_Pugh> referring to the oxygen debate as a
"futile controversy", noting that oxygen "greatly increases subjective
appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief
reasons for climbing."^[284] <#cite_note-289> For the next twenty-five
years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.

    ...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the
    summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to
    the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain
    function.

    — Thomas F. Hornbein in /The high-altitude brain/^[282] <#cite_note-
    thom-287> 

Reinhold Messner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Messner> was
the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978,
with Peter Habeler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Habeler>, made
the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the
mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing
partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing
community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without
supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of
insisting that is how it /should/ be climbed.^[25] <#cite_note-
Krakauer-1997-28> ^: 154 

The aftermath of the 1996 disaster <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1996_Mount_Everest_disaster> further intensified the debate. Jon
Krakauer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer>'s /Into Thin Air
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_Thin_Air>/ (1997) expressed the
author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer
wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified
climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more
deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of
climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at
the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after
the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen
except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the
growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes
—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.

The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using
bottled oxygen.^[285] <#cite_note-salon-290>

Guide Anatoli Boukreev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Anatoli_Boukreev>'s decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply
criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston
DeWalt, who co-wrote /The Climb <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
The_Climb_(book)>/) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense
of security.^[286] <#cite_note-291> Krakauer and his supporters point
out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his
clients descend.^[287] <#cite_note-salongarner-292>

The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive
abilities described as "delayed and lethargic thought process,
clinically defined as bradypsychia" even after returning to lower
altitudes.^[288] <#cite_note-altitude-293> In severe cases, climbers can
experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude
climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain
structure.^[288] <#cite_note-altitude-293> The effects of high altitude
on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage,
continue to be studied.^[288] <#cite_note-altitude-293>


      Autumn climbing

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Mount_Everest_as_seen_from_Drukair.jpg>Everest in September 2006

Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been
climbed in the autumn (also called the "post-monsoon season").^[67]
<#cite_note-autumn-71> ^[289] <#cite_note-fall-294> For example, in 2010
Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for
the first time in ten years.^[289] <#cite_note-fall-294> The autumn
season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because
there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable.^[290]
<#cite_note-295> However, this increased snow can make it more popular
with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.^[67]
<#cite_note-autumn-71> Two Japanese climbers also summited in October
1973.^[291] <#cite_note-296>

Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part
of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first
Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the /
Los Angeles Times <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Los_Angeles_Times>/.^[292] <#cite_note-297> By the 21st century, summer
and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on
Mount Everest.^[293] <#cite_note-298> During the 1980s, climbing in
autumn was actually more popular than in spring.^[294] <#cite_note-299>
U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Karl_Gordon_Henize> died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition,
conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background
radiation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation> increases
with higher altitudes.^[295] <#cite_note-300>

The mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not
popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter
days.^[296] <#cite_note-301> By January the peak is typically battered
by 170 mph (270 km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is
around −33 °F (−36 °C).^[67] <#cite_note-autumn-71>


      Thefts and crime

Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches.
In May 2006, Vitor Negrete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vitor_Negrete>, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and
part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear
and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.^[297]
<#cite_note-302> ^[298] <#cite_note-303> In addition to theft, Michael
Kodas describes in his book, /High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age
of Greed/ (2008):^[299] <#cite_note-304> unethical guides and Sherpas,
prostitution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Tibet> and
gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen
bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of
removing trash from the mountain.^[300] <#cite_note-305> ^[301]
<#cite_note-306>

The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as "out of control"
in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by
his Sherpa.^[302] <#cite_note-stolen-307> Another Sherpa helped the
victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other
climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth
hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents,
making it hard to safeguard against theft.^[302] <#cite_note-stolen-307>
In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps
became more common.^[303] <#cite_note-nationalgeographic.com-308>

      Summiting with disabilities

Summiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has
become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan
Gautam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshan_Gautam>, a man with no
arms who made it to the top in 2013.^[337] <#cite_note-342> A teenager
with Down syndrome <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome> made it
to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-
breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip
to the Himalayas and rustic scenery.^[338] <#cite_note-343> Danger lurks
even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in
the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2015_Mount_Everest_avalanches>. Others that have climbed Everest with
amputations include Mark Inglis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mark_Inglis> (no legs), Hari Budha Magar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Hari_Budha_Magar> (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima
Sinha <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunima_Sinha> (one leg only).

In 2001, Erik Weihenmayer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Erik_Weihenmayer> became the first person to reach the summit of Mount
Everest while blind.^[319] <#cite_note-:7-324>


    Aviation


      1933: Flight over Everest

Main article: Houston–Mount Everest flight expedition <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston%E2%80%93Mount_Everest_flight_expedition>

Lucy, Lady Houston <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy,_Lady_Houston>, a
British millionaire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire> former
showgirl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showgirl>, funded the Houston
Everest Flight of 1933. A formation of airplanes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane> led by the Marquess of Clydesdale
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-
Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton> flew over the summit in an effort to
photograph the unknown terrain.^[339] <#cite_note-344>


      1988: First climb and glide

On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east
ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marc_Boivin>
made the first paraglider <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraglider>
descent of Everest,^[313] <#cite_note-
A_view_from_the_top_of_the_world-318> in the process creating the record
for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider
flight. Boivin said: "I was tired when I reached the top because I had
broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite
hard."^[340] <#cite_note-Back-345> Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below
the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp
II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11
minutes).^[340] <#cite_note-Back-345> ^[341] <#cite_note-glider-346>
Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in
1990, BASE jumping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping> off
Venezuela's Angel Falls <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Angel_Falls>.^[342] <#cite_note-splatula-347>


      1991: Hot air balloon flyover

In 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-air_balloon> flight over Mount
Everest.^[343] <#cite_note-balloon-348> In one balloon were Andy Elson
and Eric Jones <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Jones_(climber)>
(cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Dickinson> (cameraman).^[344]
<#cite_note-elson-349> Dickinson went on to write a book about the
adventure called /Ballooning Over Everest/.^[344] <#cite_note-elson-349>
The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m
(40,000 ft) altitude.^[344] <#cite_note-elson-349> Reinhold Messner
called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the
now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kodachrome> film, the "best snap on Earth", according to UK newspaper /
The Telegraph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
The_Daily_Telegraph>/.^[345] <#cite_note-350> Dewhirst has offered to
take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per
passenger.^[343] <#cite_note-balloon-348>

AS350 B3 "Squirrel"

In May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Didier_Delsalle> of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocopter_AS350> B3 helicopter on the summit of
Mount Everest.^[346] <#cite_note-eurocopter-351> He needed to land for
two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale> (FAI) official
record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.^[346] <#cite_note-
eurocopter-351> In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which
avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set
rotorcraft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorcraft> world records
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mount_Everest_records>, for
highest of both landing and take-off.^[347] <#cite_note-fai-352>

Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a
misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South
Col two days earlier,^[348] <#cite_note-everestnet-353> with this
landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.^[347] <#cite_note-
fai-352> Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4,880 m
(16,000 ft) while he was there. One climber noted that the new record
meant a better chance of rescue.^[346] <#cite_note-eurocopter-351>


      2011: Paraglide off summit

On 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar
paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namche_Bazaar> in 42 minutes.^[279] <#cite_note-
abcnews1-284> ^[349] <#cite_note-354> After the flight they hiked,
biked, and kayaked <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayaking> to the
Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby
becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea
descent from Everest.^[350] <#cite_note-nationalgeographic1-355> They
accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never
previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing
how to swim.^[350] <#cite_note-nationalgeographic1-355> The duo
subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012
for their exploits.^[350] <#cite_note-nationalgeographic1-355> In 2013
footage of the flight was shown on the television news program /
Nightline <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightline>/.^[351]

      2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent

In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jing_(mountaineer)> used a helicopter to fly
from South base camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence
climbed to the Everest summit.^[352] <#cite_note-
nationalgeographic2-357> This climb immediately sparked outrage and
controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and
propriety of her climb.^[164] <#cite_note-
news.nationalgeographic.com-169> ^[353] <#cite_note-Gornyack-358> Nepal
ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had
flown to Camp II, admitting only that some support crew were flown to
that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.^[354] <#cite_note-359> In
August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2IIbecause
the icefall was impassable. "If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go
home", she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also
insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.^[164] <#cite_note-
news.nationalgeographic.com-169>

Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied
them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been
beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase
improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid
aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter
use in the mountaineering world.^[164] <#cite_note-
news.nationalgeographic.com-169> National Geographic noted that a
village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the
town's hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year
Award <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=International_Mountaineer_of_the_Year_Award&action=edit&redlink=1>
from the Nepal government in June 2014.^[352] <#cite_note-
nationalgeographic2-357>


      2016: Helicopter business increases

In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased
efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu
icefall.^[355] <#cite_note-blogs.dw.com-360> In particular it was noted
that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased
commercial activity at Everest.^[355] <#cite_note-blogs.dw.com-360>
After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had
wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was
not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so
this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in
rescuing many people in 2015 though).^[355] <#cite_note-
blogs.dw.com-360> That summer Bell tested the 412EPI <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_412#Variants>, which conducted a series of
tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as
6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest.^[356] <#cite_note-361>


    Extreme sports

Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring
besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and
BASE jumping.

Yuichiro Miura <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuichiro_Miura> became the
first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 1,300
vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with
extreme injuries.^[91] <#cite_note-japtimes-96> Stefan Gatt and Marco
Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.^[357] <#cite_note-
TransWorld_SNOWboarding-362> Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davo_Karni%C4%8Dar> of Slovenia, who
completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kammerlander> of Italy in 1996 on
the north side,^[358] <#cite_note-kammerlander-363> and Kit DesLauriers
of the United States in 2006.^[359] <#cite_note-Hawley-364> In 2006
Swede Tomas Olsson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomas_Olsson> and
Norwegian Tormod Granheim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tormod_Granheim> skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor
broke while they were rappelling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rappelling> down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres,
resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim
skied down to camp III.^[360] <#cite_note-skii-365> Also, Marco Siffredi
died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.^[357] <#cite_note-
TransWorld_SNOWboarding-362>

Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and
are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve
McKinney <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McKinney_(skier)> led an
expedition to Mount Everest,^[361] <#cite_note-Unsworth2000-366> during
which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang-gliding> off the mountain.^[341] <#cite_note-
glider-346> Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jean-Marc_Boivin> made the first paraglider <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Paraglider> descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in
minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.^[313] <#cite_note-
A_view_from_the_top_of_the_world-318> In 2011, two Nepalis made a
gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in
45 minutes.^[362] <#cite_note-367> On 5 May 2013, the beverage company
Red Bull <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull> sponsored Valery Rozov
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Rozov>, who successfully BASE
jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingsuit>, setting a record for world's highest
BASE jump in the process.^[363] <#cite_note-Everest_Base_Jumper-368>

    Religious significance

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rongbuk_Monastery_Everest.jpg>The
Rongphu Monastery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongphu_Monastery>,
with Mount Everest in the background

The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several "hidden
valleys" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmasambhava>, a ninth-century "lotus-born
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_birth>" Buddhist saint.^[365]
<#cite_note-natgeo1-370>

Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongbuk_Monastery>, which has been called
the "sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of
the world."^[366] <#cite_note-371> For Sherpas <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people> living on the slopes of Everest in
the Khumbu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu> region of Nepal,
Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few
days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangpa_La>.^[106] <#cite_note-Ullman-111>

Miyolangsangma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyolangsangma>, a Tibetan
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet> Buddhist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist> "/Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving/", is
believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa
Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground,
and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived
without invitation.^[365] <#cite_note-natgeo1-370>

The Sherpa people <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people> also
believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual
energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred
landscape. Here, the karmic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma>
effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best
avoided.^[365] <#cite_note-natgeo1-370>


    Waste management

Further information: Impacts of tourism § Mount Everest <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impacts_of_tourism#Mount_Everest>

In 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned
that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As
much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left
behind on the mountain.^[367] <#cite_note-372> Human waste is strewn
across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping
areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human
excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing
on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in
holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or
simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their
tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about
contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 5,500 m
(18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest
because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s,
expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic
190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and
enclosed.^[368] <#cite_note-373>

The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne
waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The
Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms
of waste when descending the mountain.^[369] <#cite_note-374>

In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the
base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits.
Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongbuk_Monastery>.^[370] <#cite_note-375>

In April 2019, the Solukhumbu district <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Solukhumbu_District>'s Khumbu Pasanglhamu <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Khumbu_Pasanglhamu> Rural Municipality launched a campaign to
collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest.^[371] <#cite_note-376>

 4. ^ Jump up to: ^/*a*/ <#cite_ref-base_51-0> ^/*b*/ <#cite_ref-
    base_51-1> The "base" of a mountain is a problematic notion in
    general with no universally accepted definition. However, for a peak
    rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali,
    an "approximate" height above "base" can be calculated. Everest is
    more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain
    on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of "base" has
    even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the
    range of numbers for "height above base" is wider. In general,
    comparisons based on "height above base" are somewhat suspect.
 5. *^ <#cite_ref-80>* In the table below, the temperature given is the

    degrees Celsius.

    6%, which translates to a 14% reduction in oxygen uptake for the
